# Java-Chat-System-Using-GUI
Hi Everyone Glad to see your interest in this repo and welcome,
This is a simple chat programmed in Java and Swing, using sockets. There is a client and a server, which can send messages between them using a username. The server defines the IP and the port, and the client needs to specify it in order to talk to the desired server. Once connected, they will be able to send messages between them.
